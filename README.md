# 90Days
90 Day Challange

This is an Ionic/Angular sample project that uses FireBase for authentication and hosting the URL data for the "Item of the Day" button. 
If logged into an admin account, there will be a button on the nav bar to add a new item of the day via url. 

You may use this as a template or project freely, please just change to your Firebase account. 
Also, give credit where credit is due please :)
